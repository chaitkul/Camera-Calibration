# Camera-Calibration

Assuming a pinhole camera model and ignoring radial distortion, we will be relying on a
calibration target (checkerboard in our case) to estimate the camera parameters. The calibration
target used can be found here.
This was printed on an A4 paper and the size of each square is 21.5 mm. 
Thirteen images taken from a Google Pixel XL phone with focus locked can be used to calibrate.

The intrinsic matrix and the reprojection error will be printed in the terminal.
